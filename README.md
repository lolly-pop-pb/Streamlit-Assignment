# Iris IDEAS-TIH

### Interactive Data Exploration and Analysis Suite

## Overview

**Iris IDEAS-TIH** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** for exploring, analyzing, and modeling the classic **Iris dataset**.  
It demonstrates end-to-end integration of **data visualization**, **machine learning**, and **SQL querying** within a lightweight graphical interface.

The project was developed under the **TIH IDEAS Program** to promote applied data science, reproducibility, and hands-on learning through open-source technologies.

---

## Objectives

- To enable accessible data exploration through an interactive UI.  
- To implement and compare classification models on the Iris dataset.  
- To allow real-time SQL querying using an in-memory database.  
- To demonstrate packaging of Streamlit apps into standalone executables.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview**: Displays sample data and basic descriptive statistics.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates interactive visualizations such as pairplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.  
- **Classification Models**: Allows training and evaluation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.  
- **SQL Playground**: Enables interactive querying through **DuckDB**, supporting custom SQL statements.  
- **Standalone Deployment**: Provides an installer configuration for converting the app into a Windows `.exe` file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 (64-bit)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Iris-IDEAS-TIH.git
   cd Iris-IDEAS-TIH/Iris

2. **Install dependencies**
``bash
pip install -r packages.txt
3. **Run the application**
```bash
python run_app.py
```
The app will automatically open in your browser at:
http://127.0.0.1:8501

Building the Executable (.exe)
This project uses Pynsist to convert the Streamlit application into a standalone Windows executable.
4. **Build the Installer**
Run the following command from the project root:
```bash
pynsist installer.cfg
```
---

## Installer Generation

This will generate an installer in the `build/` directory.  
Example output:  
`build/nsis/Iris-IDEAS-TIH_1.0.exe`

### Install and Launch the Application

1. Double-click the generated `.exe` installer.  
2. Complete the installation wizard.  
3. Once installed, launch the app directly from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.  
4. The Streamlit interface will open automatically in your web browser.

### Impediments Faced

- Resolving dependency conflicts during Windows packaging.  
- Managing Streamlit’s subprocess behavior while auto-launching in browsers.  
- Rendering performance for large Seaborn pairplots.  
- Integrating AgGrid display with DuckDB query outputs.  
- File path consistency across different build environments.

### Learnings

- Streamlit multi-page app structure and routing.  
- Implementation of machine learning workflows in web applications.  
- Practical experience with DuckDB for in-memory analytics.  
- Creation of distributable executables using Pynsist.  
- Visualization best practices for small-scale datasets.
